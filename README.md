# 🧮 Math

One of my two majors in college was Mathematics and, in an effort to hold on to the pure math knowledge that I no longer regularly use, I've begun working through some of the math textbooks in my collection. This respository stores the notes that I've taken from those books, some important results, and some practice problems.

## 📙 Textbooks
- [Understanding Analysis - Stephen Abbott (2nd Edition)](/Understanding-Analysis/)

## ✏️ Corrections
It's possible that a proof or solution error made it into the notes! Whether it's an illogical argument or a small typo I'd appreciate your feedback. Please do open an issue and let me know what needs fixing.
